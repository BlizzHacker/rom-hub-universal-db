"""Universal-DB's published catalogue, and what one entry means.

`https://db.universal-team.net/data/full.json` is the whole database in one
response: a JSON **list** of 400 entries, 1.66 MB, HTTP 200 with no
redirect. There is no smaller or paginated form -- `data/3ds.json`,
`data/ds.json` and `data/index.json` all 404 with an HTML body -- so a
query is answered by fetching the list and filtering it here. That is the
opposite of the Homebrew Hub plugin, which pushes the query to a server,
and it is a deliberate consequence of the source: this one publishes a
file, not a search API.

The 404-with-HTML shape is why every read checks `status_code` first. A
parser that only tried `json.loads` would report "not JSON" for what is
really "that path does not exist".

An entry is a record from an open, reviewable repository
(`Universal-Team/db`, GPL-3.0), so its fields are as complete as whoever
submitted it made them. Of the 400 live entries, 130 carry no `license`
key, 17 carry no downloads at all, and one spells its author key `Author`
rather than `author` -- so nothing here treats a field as guaranteed.

**Licence is surfaced, never invented.** It is the reason this source is
usable at all, so it belongs in front of the operator. An entry that does
not state one reads `unstated`, which is a fact about the database and not
a synonym for "public domain".
